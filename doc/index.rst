Wigner symbols for Python
=========================

py3nj is a small library to calculate Wigner symbols, such as wigner's 3j, 6j,
9j symbols, as well as Clebsch Gordan coefficients.

py3nj mostly wraps the original Fortran implementation in slatec,
but it is designed to highly compatible to numpy's nd-array,
i.e. the automatic vectorization is supported.
